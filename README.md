# Website-Christian-Hackbarth-Johnson

## Description

I am uploading a selection of the code for Christian Hackbarth-Johnson's personal website.

The website is not live yet and still in progress so I can only provide some of the code here. 

I have made the home and contact pages available in addition to the CSS file, the header, footer and navigation files that are included in each individual page and the forms that process the contact form and the newsletter subscription.

The website is in German so the code has a mix of German and English, depending on the specific need of the items.

## Features

- Contact form and newsletter subscription forms which are available on the contact page, but also other pages on the site.

- Picture slideshow which is shown at the bottom of the "Indienreise.php" page that includes a CSS animation

- Universal header, footer and navigation that is used in each page

- Hover activated dropdown menu (which will be changed on mobile when responsive design is added) that can be found in "Navigation.php"

- Div based layout that uses flexbox in some places.

## Planned

- Responsive design

- Events page that automatically sorts events by day
