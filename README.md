# Website-Christian-Hackbarth-Johnson

## UPDATE

The website is now LIVE! You can see it at [Christian Hackbarth-Johnson](https://hackbarth-johnson.de/)

## Description

I am uploading a selection of the code for Christian Hackbarth-Johnson's personal website.

I can only provide some of the code here. 

I have made the home and contact pages available in addition to the CSS file, the header, footer and navigation files that are included in each individual page and the forms that process the contact form and the newsletter subscription.

The website is in German so the code has a mix of German and English, depending on the specific need of the items.

## Features

- Contact form and newsletter subscription forms which are available on the contact page, but also other pages on the site and in the footer.

- Picture slideshow which is shown at the bottom of the "Indienreise.php" page that includes a CSS animation

- Universal header, footer and navigation that is used in each page

- Hover and tab activated dropdown menu that can be found in "Navigation.php"

- Div based layout that uses flexbox in some places, update: added semantic HTML elements where it makes sense

- Events page that automatically sorts events by day, see in 'Aktuelles.php' and 'ChristianClassesEvents.php'

- Option for the website owner to add his own events to the event page (code not public)
