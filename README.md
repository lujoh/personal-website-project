# Website-Christian-Hackbarth-Johnson

## Description

I am uploading a selection of the code for Christian Hackbarth-Johnson's personal website.

The website is not live yet so I can only provide some of the code here. 

I have made the home and contact pages available in addition to the CSS file, the header, footer and navigation files that are included in each individual page and the forms that process the contact form and the newsletter subscription.

The website is in German so the code has a mix of German and English, depending on the specific need of the items.
